/** 

Okay so let's just see what needs doing now. 

First of all I pretty much have all the UI components I need. 

Most of them still need styling and Polishing and extra responsiveness 

will need adding in. 

Okay so at the moment I just need to work out the structure. 

First of all I think it would be good to work on the Navbar 

and then the Mobile navbar. 

I'll need to go through the example and then create a plan and a list for everything 

that needs changing and the tasks that need doing. 

Once that has been done then I need to add in some basic styling and content. 

Then I can move onto the other UI components. 

I can move onto the recently made UI components are really get each one completely 

polished out and properly styled and all the responsiveness added in then 

I can move onto integrating everything and doing the last finishing touches and integration 
task. 

Then once that has been done I can add in the final styling, Effects and then 

animations. 

And once all of those things have been properly done then I can move onto adding in the 

functionality and the functional components. 


Then once that has been done and all the polishing and integration tasks have also 

been properly completed then it'll be time to start creating the 

other functional components from scratch. 

Once these components have been properly developed and polished and tested then 

it'll be time to integrate them and polish them as well do all the other 

integration tasks. 

Once that has been done when I can focus on launching and hosting the website. 


Then once this project has been done I can work on Creating a list of 

robust, reusable and responsive UI components that are properly polished and 

styled that come with all the effects and animations needed. 


I can use these components for future projects. 

Then once I have the needed UI components and I have a whole library of effects and 

animations both CSS and framer motion animations then I can move onto 

Creating a whole list of more functional components to give my future projects 

more functionality. 


Once those have been properly tested and polished then I can move onto my next projects. 

It would probably be good to move onto a major project that I can integrate 

into my future projects. 

And then after that and a few Python projects I can move onto a capstone project 

like the Crypto App. 

Then Once that is done I can make a few really nice looking clones and then get into 

freelance web development. 

Once I have thing rolling along nicely with that then I can start on a real world 


project and create a shell company and start doing team work using git, scrum, 
sprints, and slack as well as the whole package of real development pipelines, devops and 

unit testing, as well as end to end testing and the other types of required testing. 


Then I can start applying in all the different creative ways. 

And if that doesn't work I can try volunteering, doing open source work, as well as creating 
a whole creative strategy of applying to jobs as if I'm a developer with over 2 years of 

real world development experience.


Then in the mean time I can slowly build out all my money making ideas to make a 

bit of money on the side just to smooth things out a bit especially if there 

is going to be some financial hardship. 


Okay so that sounds like a plan.

Okay so now that I have a general idea on what is going on I just need to 

focus down and get each UI component polished one at a time. 

So let's just work out what needs doing right now. 


Well first of all I have the see through Nav bar. 


So first of all I need to add in the right buttons and the make sure that they are the right size 
and in the right place. 

Once that is done then I need to work on the size and positioning of the 

hamburger menu opening button. 

Once that is done then I need to work on the 

actual hamburger menu. 

First of all I need to disable scrolling. This will anchor the close button in place 

and mean that the user is not able to move it around. 

Next I need to move the close button into the right place. 

Then Once that is done I need to work on the placement, sizing and styling of the 

logo button and the other menu buttons as well as social media icons. 

Then once that is done I just need to do more polishing and make sure that everything is 

fully responsive. So once that is done then for the most part the hamburger menu will be 

done. There will probably need to be quite a bit of polishing still but that will be done for 
the most part. 

Next we have the navbar Logo. 

One will need to be designed and added in. 

Once that is done then it's the sizing and placement of the navbar as well as a few other things that 
will need to be polished up for the navbar. 

Then once the navbar is done then it'll be time to move onto the hero section. 

The first thing that needs to be done to the hero section is that the right image and 
image size will need to be added in. 


Then the right image size will need to be added in for the screen size with media queries. 

Once that is done then the CTA section as well as the hero Text. 

The placement, styling, and sizing will all need to be adjusted. 

Once that is done then I can move onto the other UI components like the YouTube CTA and Give 
CTA as well as the Contact Form, Footer, General CTA, and Cards.
